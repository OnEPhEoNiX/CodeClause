# Flight-Delay-Prediction-Model

Flight Delay Prediction is a common machine learning task that involves building a model to predict the likelihood of a flight being delayed based on various features or factors. It is a valuable application in the aviation industry, allowing airlines, airports, and passengers to anticipate potential delays and take necessary actions.

To perform Flight Delay Prediction, a dataset containing historical flight data is typically used. This dataset includes information about flights such as departure time, arrival time, airline, origin airport, destination airport, weather conditions, and other relevant variables. These features serve as inputs to the machine learning model, which learns patterns and relationships in the data to make predictions.

There are several publicly available datasets that can be used for Flight Delay Prediction. One popular dataset is the "Flight Delay and Cancellation" dataset provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) in the United States. This dataset contains historical flight data for domestic flights within the United States and includes information such as flight details, airline information, departure and arrival times, and delay information.

You can access the "Flight Delay and Cancellation" dataset from the following link:

This dataset is available in CSV format and can be downloaded for further analysis and modeling. It provides a rich source of information for exploring flight delay patterns, developing predictive models, and gaining insights into factors that contribute to flight delays.

By leveraging machine learning algorithms and techniques on flight delay datasets, it becomes possible to develop accurate prediction models that can assist airlines, airports, and passengers in making informed decisions and improving overall flight operations and travel experiences.
